# use for postgres.
POSTGRES_DB_HOST='localhost'
POSTGRES_DB_USER='postgres'
POSTGRES_DB_PASSWORD='password'
POSTGRES_DB_NAME='database_name' #also set multiple database names separated by comma.i.e. 'database_name,database_name2,database_name3'

POSTGRES_DB_PORT=5432
#ignore postgres config in env if not used.


# use for mysql.
MYSQL_DB_HOST='localhost'

To send backup through mail you need to add mail credentials to .env.

  MAIL_PASSWORD='example password'
```

Set the cronjob.

```bash
crontab -e

#at the crontab file, add the following script.
#minute hour dayOfMonth month dayOfWeek commandToRun
* * * * * commandToRun {_ can be any value}~~

_OR, you can use process managers as_

```
pm2 start src/index.js --name dbbackup --cron "* * * * *"
```

## Todos

- [ ] S3 Bucket Integration (Currently, the backup db is only sent to GMAIL. When GMAIL gets full, s3 can be our alternative. For this, we check for `BACKUP_DEST=S3_BUCKET`)
- [ ] Multiple Email Support (Currently, only one email can be sent. We can add multiple emails to send the backup to multiple people)
- [ ] To make project CLI Based (Since we have `scripts/dump_data_for_test.sh` which we have to do manually, but if we can make cli based from `index.sh` then it will be more user friendly; by providing flags)
