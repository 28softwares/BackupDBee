    user: process.env.DB_USER,
    password: process.env.DB_PASSWORD,
    type: "postgres",
    mail_backup: true  // In case you want to send backups to your email, {default:false}
    // Other configuration (Optional)

```bash
    crontab -e

    #at the crontab file, add the following script.

    #minute hour dayOfMonth month dayOfWeek commandToRun
* * * * * commandToRun {_ can be any value}
